# React (new tags)

Working with React to create new tags.

To translate new tags, we'll need Babel, a JavaScript compiler, which will convert the tags we create with React into JavaScript that can be  understood by the browser.

We'll use Node.js to serve our pages and run Babel. 

In progress: Could not find a version of Babel that will run in the browser.

## Tools

* Chrome Browser for viewing.
* Visual Studio Code for editing.
* Node.js (lastest LTS version) to serve our pages.
* Babel.js (to translate our new tags to JavaScript)

Install Node.js following the instructions on the website. 

In your react-new-tags folder, open a PowerShell (or command window) and test it has installed correcty:

```PowerShell
npm --version
```

## To Experiment

1. Fork repo to your own cloud account.
2. Clone your repo down to your laptop.
3. Install Node.js
4. Check the version number as described above.
5. Edit: Open the react-no-tools folder in Visual Studio Code to edit.

Open a PowerShell terminal as Admin to install the dependencies listed in package.json, fire up the server, and run the app with:

```PowerShell
npm install
node app.js
```
